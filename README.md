# Insertion-sort

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted.

Algorithm

Step 1 − If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;

Step 2 − Pick next element

Step 3 − Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list

Step 4 − Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-list that is greater than the 
         value to be sorted

Step 5 − Insert the value

Step 6 − Repeat until list is sorted.
